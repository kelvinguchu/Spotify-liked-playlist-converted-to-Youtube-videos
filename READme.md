# Youtubify

Youtubify is a web application that integrates both Spotify and YouTube to fetch and display your liked songs from Spotify along with their corresponding YouTube videos.

## Features

1. **Spotify Authentication**: Users can log in using their Spotify account to fetch their liked songs.
2. **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users can easily switch between light and dark themes for better visual comfort.
3. **YouTube Video Search**: For every liked song on Spotify, the app searches YouTube for its official music video and displays it.
4. **Seamless User Experience**: With a smooth loading animation, users are never left wondering about the state of their request.
5. **User Profile Display**: After successful authentication, users can see their Spotify display name and avatar.
6. **Song Search**: Users can search for specific songs within their playlist.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structuring the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling the web application. The Poppins font from Google Fonts is used for a clean UI.
- **JavaScript**: Responsible for all the dynamic functionalities including API requests and DOM manipulations.

## How to Use

1. Click on the login button to authenticate with Spotify.
2. Once authenticated, the app will fetch your liked songs from Spotify.
3. For each song, the app will then fetch its corresponding YouTube video.
4. All the songs along with their videos will be displayed on the main page.
5. Use the search bar to search for specific songs in your playlist.
6. Toggle between light and dark themes using the dark mode button.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a caching mechanism to store previous search results and reduce the number of API calls.
- Allow users to curate their own playlists and fetch YouTube videos accordingly.

## Local Development

Contact me via my Twitter direct message to send the code files.
The reason for this is that I cannot expose my API keys.

## Acknowledgments
